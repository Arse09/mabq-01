# MABQ-01: Multi-purpose Arduino-Based Quadcopter â€“ 2025

**Author:** Arse09  
**Started:** March 2025  
**Finished:** In progress  

## ðŸš€ About MABQ-01

**MABQ-01** is my first project combining **C++**, **Arduino**, and **PCB design**.  
Itâ€™s a custom Arduino-based quadcopter system, consisting of a drone and a dedicated controller.  
This project pushed me to learn essential skills in electronics, the c++ language, and hardware development.

Special thanks to my secondary school, **IES Siglo XXI** (Spain), for providing the resources, environment, and encouragement to carry out this project.  
Iâ€™d also like to thank my programming and robotics teacher, **Maite Fano**, for her guidance and support throughout the process.

Developed as a learning experience and shared as an open-source initiative.
